the traditional model has 5 layers :\
1.Application layer, which uses Http.\
2.Transportation layer, which uses the TCP/UDP protocol to transmit data. the TCP protocol provides reliable byte stream, and sometimes the server needs a faster protocol, which is the UCP protocol.
3.Network layer, which uses the IP address protocol to locate the destination Host.\
4.Link layer, such as a switch.
5.Physic layer, which includes RJ45 connector and optical fiber cable
